=========================
(slide 1)

*Introduction*

* Dreams

* Text mining

* Goals:
  - assist in clinical practice;
  - making art








=========================
(slide 2)

*Materials: corpus*

Two collections

     File           & Characters & Tokens  & Sentences  & Paragraphs  & Date
     corpora.txt    & 9456       & 1693    & 104        & 30          & Mar/2015
     corpora2.txt   & 71514      & 14691   & 435        & 156         & Nov/2015














=========================
(slide 3)

*Methods*

- Separations between punctuations, stopwords and the rest

- Filtering and ordering

- Choosing the resulting texts that were more useful










=========================
(slide 4)

*Results*

* Ordering by: number of incidence, alphabet, size in characters

* Words filtered by number os vowels, fricatives, plosives, position
in sentence, collocations

* Used to derive many texts that were read in clinical sessions
and fed to a metamedia-instrument

* Documents with the texts and organizations of them

(slide 5)

*Result example*

Escorregava glandes     & Slipping glands     
Numa assustavam         & At once, they scared
Eu suada                & I sweated           
As cavalos              & The horses          
Não acabou              & It's not over       
Barras mim              & Bars me             
Andei construtores      & I walked builders   
Pessoas )               & People  )           

Sonhei formei           & I dreamed I formed  
Estava menino           & It was boy          
Depois boa              & Then good           
Esse meu                & This mine           
Sonhos descendo         & Dreams coming down  

O irmão                 & The brother         
Meu punição             & My punishment       
Começa irmão            & Begins brother      
Meu ele                 & My him              
Meu demonstração        & My demonstration    
Depois ”                & After "             
Eu parede               & I wall              
Sinto dele              & I'm fell him        
A importência           & The ``importence''  
O buraco                & The hole            

Acordei ofegante        & Woke up breathless  
Sensação NÃO            & Feeling NO          
Já rumo                 & I'm on my way       
Estava perseguido       & Was persecuted      
Quando percebeu         & When realized       
A tempo                 & In time             
Até porta               & Up to door          
O disso                 & The this            
Eu sobreviver           & I survive           
Parecia ferramentas     & Seemed like tools   

Três mim                & Three of me
Lavo piano              & I wash piano
Havia tirano            & There was a tyrant
Nele tudo               & In him all
Jogaram fogo            & They set fire
Pessoas presas          &  People trapped
Comecei ali             & I started there
Mas destruísse          & But destroy
Pessoas criança         & Children people

*Conclusions*

* Results compelling for art and clinical psychology

* Very simple methods

* Unique in using text mining of descriptions of dreams for
clinical psychology and arts?

* Future:
  - Expand the corpus
  - Enhance the filtering of words by metric and sonorities
  - Classification, Wordnet
